With over a decade of experience as a DevOps Engineer, I have a solid background in managing multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud, Cloudflare) with security at the core. I am a strong proponent of "Infrastructure as Code," designing and building CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows on platforms such as Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions. My experience with bash scripting, Python Terraform and CloudFormation allows me to effectively improve developers' velocity. I have been a strong advocate of DevOps principles to enhance collaboration, thereby improving the speed, quality, and reliability of software delivery. Furthermore, I have successfully led ISO 27001 certification and penetration testing and mitigation.
